# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
Working with Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis I have created a series of queries and tables to understand which employees will most likely be retiring in the near future, and will need retirement packages. This information will be extremely useful for budgeting purposes and for HR to be prepared to fill roles as people leave. 

## Results: 
Here are some of the key findings from this analysis. They can all be found within new tables in our PH-EmployeeDB in Postgres, or exported as csv files. 
* A concise list of current employees at Pewlett Hackard
* A list of just current managers at Pewlett Hackard
* List of employees eligible for retirement 
* Total count of roles with employees eligible for retirement
* Employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program 

## Summary
Through these queries we can see:
1.  Pewlett Packard has 5 department managers at this time. Given that there are 9 departments, there are open department roles that can be filled.
